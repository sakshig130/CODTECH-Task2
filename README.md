Overview of the Project

Project- Weather Forecasting Website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The program is a simple weather application that allows users to enter a city name and retrieve the current weather information for that city. The program uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and updates the HTML page with the retrieved information.

Components

The program consists of the following components:

# HTML Page: The HTML page contains the user interface elements, including:
-> A text input field for the user to enter the city name
A button to submit the city name and retrieve the weather data
HTML elements to display the weather information, such as:
1. City name
2. Current date
3. Weather icon
4. Temperature
5. Weather description
6. Wind speed
#JavaScript Code:
 The JavaScript code is responsible for:

Handling the user input (city name) and submitting it to the OpenWeatherMap API

Fetching the weather data from the API

Parsing the API response and extracting the relevant weather information

Updating the HTML page with the retrieved weather information

#Program Flow

Here is the program flow:

The user enters a city name in the text input field and clicks the submit button.
The JavaScript code retrieves the city name from the input field and constructs an API endpoint URL using the OpenWeatherMap API.
The JavaScript code sends a GET request to the API endpoint using the fetch API.
The API responds with the weather data for the specified city in JSON format.
The JavaScript code parses the API response and extracts the relevant weather information.
The JavaScript code updates the HTML page with the retrieved weather information using jQuery.
The user can see the current weather information for the specified city on the HTML page.
